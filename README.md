![df0gjg6-4b1b7525-9a79-43c3-b27e-58371db4fb94](https://github.com/shridharkamathe/Titanic/assets/124047047/0063beb0-d567-4fbf-af19-d4bda8502d31)

This repository contains an analysis of the Titanic passengers dataset, focusing on the correlation between various parameters such as passenger class, gender, and age for survival rate. Additionally, a Power BI dashboard has been created to visualize the findings.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. It provides details such as passenger class, gender, age, and survival status. The dataset is available in CSV format and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Analysis

The analysis aims to uncover insights into the factors that influenced survival rates among Titanic passengers. The following correlations are examined:

1. **Passenger Class:** The correlation between passenger class (First, Second, Third) and survival rate is explored. This will help determine if there was a significant difference in survival rates based on class.

2. **Gender:** The correlation between gender (male, female) and survival rate is examined. This analysis will shed light on whether gender played a role in the chances of survival.

3. **Age:** The correlation between age and survival rate is analyzed. This investigation will reveal if age had any impact on the likelihood of survival.

## Power BI Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard has been created to visualize the findings of the analysis. Power BI is a business analytics tool that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities. The dashboard offers an intuitive interface to explore and understand the correlations between different parameters and survival rates among Titanic passengers.

The Power BI dashboard includes various charts and graphs that present the data in a comprehensive manner. Users can interact with the dashboard to filter and drill down into specific segments of the dataset, enabling a deeper understanding of the correlations.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **data**: This directory contains the Titanic passengers dataset in CSV format.

- **notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. The notebooks are numbered in the order they should be executed.

- **powerbi**: This directory includes the Power BI file (.pbix) containing the dashboard visualization.

- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the repository and its contents.

## Usage

To reproduce the analysis and explore the Power BI dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Power BI file in the `powerbi` directory using Power BI Desktop or upload it to the Power BI service for online access.

3. Interact with the Power BI dashboard to explore the correlations between passenger class, gender, age, and survival rate.
